### Overview
A *statement* is a basic unit in a **C++** program. A statement always ends with a semicolon, the semicolon is what ends a statement but not the end of the line. Statements define something, usually something to be computed. 
### Key Concepts
We can type `int` in front of a name, which defines the data type to be stored. We are also able to enclose several statements between curly braces `{ }`, we would call this a *statement block*. Consequently, blocks can be placed inside other blocks, this is called *nesting* 
### Code
Example:
```cpp 
int answer{42}; // This is a statement defining an answer with the number 42

// These are also valid formats for a statement
int one{ 1 };
int two{2};
int  three  {
   3
};
```
