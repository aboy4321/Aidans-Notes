### Overview
A function is a named block of code that carries out a defined procedure. To execute/call the code, you would simply just have to type out its name. There must be one function named `main` and execution would start with this function.
### Key Concepts
Functions give us several advantages:
- Simplifying code in **discrete functions** that are easier to develop and test
-  and allows us to reuse code at different locations
### Code

```cpp 
int main()
```
This would be called a function header, here `int` is a type name which defines the data type that will be returned when `main()` executes, in this case being an integer.
