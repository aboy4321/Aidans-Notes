### Overview
Input and outputs in **C++** are performed using *streams*. To output data, we would write it to an *output stream*. A *stream* is an abstract representation of a source of data.
### Key Concepts
A stream is tied to a specific device that is the source of the data in the case of an input stream and the destination for the data in the case of an output stream. There is an advantage to this is the programming is generally the same regardless of the device that the stream represents
### Code

```cpp
std::cout << std::format("Hello {}", name)
		  << std:endl;
std::cout << "Hello " << name << std::endl;		
```
- The standard output and input streams in **C++** are called `std::cout` and `std::cin` respectively.
- `std::format` returns a formatted character sequence in a string object.
- `<<` is the *stream insertion operator* that transfers data to the stream, whatever appears to the right of `<<` is transferred to `std::cout`.
