### Overview
We make the last line in a `main()` is a `return` statement. A `return` statement ends a function and returns control to where the function was called. A `return` statement may or may not return a value.
### Key Concepts
Returning a 0 to the system would indicates that the program ended normally.
### Code
Example:
```cpp
int main(){
	// Insert whatever code
	return 0;
}
```
