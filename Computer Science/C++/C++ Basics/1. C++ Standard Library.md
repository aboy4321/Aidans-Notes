### Overview
**C++ 23** comes with its **standard library**, which is basically a huge collection of classes and functions which would reduce the need to write our own functions for something trivial. Very handy.
### Key Concepts
Because of this library we can skip importing some specific simple modules and just use the `std` library as an umbrella to reduce redundant code.
### Code

```C++
import std;
```

This line would import the **standard module** and allow us to use all classes and functions within it.
