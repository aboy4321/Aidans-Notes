### Integer Variables
Here is a statement that defines an integer value: `int apple_count;`. this would define a variable of the type `int`. We can also specify an initial value like this: `int apple_count {15};`.

We can also define and initialize multiple variables of a given type in one statement.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <format>

int main(){
	int apple_count {10};
	int orange_count {5};
	int total_count {orange_count + apple_count};
	std::cout << std::format("The total number of fruit is {}", total_count) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
### Signed Integer Types
*Signed Integers* are both positive and negative values. We can allocate memory for each type, and hence the range of values it can store.

| Type Name                                                                   | Byte Size |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `signed char`                                                               | 1         |
| `short short int signed` and `short signed short int`                       | 2         |
| `int signed signed int`                                                     | 4         |
| `long long int signed` and `long signed long int`                           | 4 or 8    |
| `long long long long int` and `signed long long signed` and `long long int` | 8         |
### Unsigned Integer Types
In cases where we need to describe a non-negative value, we can specify integer type by prefixing the name with `unsigned`. Each `unsigned` type occupies the same memory.
