## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
A *matrix* $A$ represents a linear equation $Ax=b$ where $A$ is defined as a linear combination of the columns of $A$.

So a solution $x$ exists **ONLY** if $b$ is in the column space of $A$ , where $A$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of $A's$  columns.

The *inverse matrix* of $A$, denoted by $A^{-1}$, exists for invertible matrices $A$, giving us a unique solution of $x=A^{-1}b$
## Additional Idea(s)
*Independence* means there only solution to $Ax=0$,  implying $A$ is invertible.

*Dependence* would occur when $Ax=0$ has non-zero solutions, making $A$ singular and therefore not invertible.
