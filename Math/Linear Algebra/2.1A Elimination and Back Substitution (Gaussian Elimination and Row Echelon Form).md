## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
Given a system of linear equations:$$ 
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\dots+a_{1n}x_n\quad =\quad b_1 \\
a_{21x_1}+a_{22}x_2+\dots+a_{2n}x_n\quad=\quad b_2\\
\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\quad\quad\dots\\
a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\dots+a_{mn}x_n\quad=b_m
\end{cases}
$$
where $a_{ij,} i=1,\dots,m$ and $j=1,\dots,n$ are real numbers we can efficiently solve this system using **gaussian elimination**.

We wan to represent the entire system using a single matrix that contains all of the coefficients and constants, this matrix being called the **augmented matrix:**$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} & b_1 \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n} & b_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn} & b_m \\
\end{array}\right]$$
The vertical bar separates the coefficients ($a_{ij}$) from the constants ($b_i$).

Through this process we are only allowed to use *three operations*
1. **Interchange**: swapping the position of two rows ($R_i \leftrightarrow R_j$)
2. **Scale**: Multiply an entire row by a non-zero scalar ($kR_i \rightarrow R_i$ where $k \ne 0$)
3. **Replacement**: Replace a row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row ($R_i + kR_j \rightarrow R_i$)

Our goal is to use these row operations to convert the left part of the augmented/coefficient matrix into **row echelon form**. A matrix is **row echelon form** if it has the following *three* properties:
1. All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros,
2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.
3. All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros

If a matrix in row echelon form satisfies the following *two* conditions then it is in **reduced row echelon form**.
- The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1.
- Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.

An augmented matrix may be **row reduced** to more than one matrix in row echelon form.
