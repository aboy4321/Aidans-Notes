## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
The *dot product* of a vector $v$ and $w$ is denoted $v\cdot w$. This would be in the form$$v\cdot w=v_1w_1+v_2w_2$$
In vectors, we define the *length/magnitude* of a vector $v$ as the square root of its own dot product$$||v||=\sqrt{v\cdot v}=\sqrt{(v_1^2+v_2^2+\dots+v_n^2)}$$
*Unit vectors*, vectors whose length equals one, so $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}=1$. We can find the unit vector (which is basically the direction), with this expression$$\vec{u}=\frac{v}{||v||}$$
## Additional Idea(s)
When the *dot product* is **zero**, we can say the vectors are perpendicular and the angle between them is $90\degree$

**Schwarz Inequality:**$$|v\cdot w|\leq||v||\;||w||$$
**Triangle Inequality:**$$||v+w||\leq||v||+||w||$$
