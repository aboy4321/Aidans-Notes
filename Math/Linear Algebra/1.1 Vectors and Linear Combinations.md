## Definition
- A *vector* is a mathematical object that is given both magnitude/quantity and direction

- A *linear combination* is a new vector formed by multiplying each vector by a real number, then adding the results together
## Additional Ideas
### Vector Addition/Subtraction 
Given a vector $v = \begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\end{bmatrix}$ and $w=\begin{bmatrix}w_1\\w_2\end{bmatrix}$ we are able to perform *vector addition* like this$$v+w=\begin{bmatrix}v_1+w_1\\v_2+w_2\end{bmatrix}$$
*Vector subtraction* follows the same idea

### Scalar Multiplication
Given a constant $c$ and a vector $v = \begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\end{bmatrix}$ we perform *scalar multiplication like this*$$cv=\begin{bmatrix}cv_1\\cv_2\end{bmatrix}$$
The combination of these operators is called a *linear combination*
