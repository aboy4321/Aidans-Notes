## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
A *first order linear diff equation* is an ODE where only the 1st derivative appears and the variables within are only to the first power, thus being linear, usually taking the form$$u'+h(t)\cdot u=g(t)$$
An *integrating factor* is used to solve a first order ODE, they are multiplying factors used to turn our inexact function, into an exact function that can integrate cleanly.

We find our *integrating factor* $e^{H(t)}$ by taking $H(t)$ to any specific antiderivative of $h(t)$ and multiply both sides of the equation by that integrating factor then integrate.$$\int(e^{H(t)}u(t))'\cdot dt=\int e^{H(t)}g(t)dt$$
Then we multiply both sides by $e^{-H(t)}$ to get $$u(t)=e^{-H(t)}\int e^{H(t)}g(t)dt$$
