## Definition
The *simplest differential equations* have the form$$u'=f(t)$$
In the above equation, $f$ is some given function of $t$ and $u$ is an unknown function of $t$. With this form we can say that the derivative of a function $u$ is equivalent to $f$.

In Leibniz notation, we can write the same form as$$\frac{du}{dt} = f(t)$$

### General Solution/Family of solutions
The set of all solutions of a differential equation is called the *general solution* or the *family of solutions*, where if a *differential equation* has a solution with a constant $C$, then it has **infinitely** many solutions.
