## Definition
A *differential equation* with an imposed initial condition is called an *initial value problem*, and takes the form$$\begin{gather}u'=f(t)\\u(t_0)=u_0\end{gather}$$
This basically means that a differential equation of the simplest form (refer to [[1.1 The Simplest First Order Differential Equations]]) has infinitely but an initial value problem for the differential equation has just one solution.
