## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
For some context, *carbon dating* is a method used by scientists to determine the age  of fossils, the basic idea being this method is supposed to measure the amount of the radioactive isotope     Carbon-14 that is present in a fossil and compare it to the amount that would be present when the fossil was alive.

To model carbon dating using ODE's, let time $t=0$ be the time of death, $C_0 > 0$ be the amount of carbon-14 present in the organism while it was alive, and $C(t)$ be the amount of carbon-14 be the amount of carbon-14 at any time $t>0$, making $C$ the solution of thee initial value problem$$\begin{gather}C'=kC\\C(0)=C_0\end{gather}$$
where $k$ is a constant, the solution of this initial value problem being$$C(t)=C_0e^{kt}$$
