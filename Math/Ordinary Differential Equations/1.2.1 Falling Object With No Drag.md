## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
An object that does **NOT** experience drag force is called a *free-falling object* which can only occur in the absence of air particles.
## Additional Idea(s)
We can model the motion of an object in free-fall with two equations$$\begin{gather}v(t)=gt+C\\y(t)=\frac12gt^2+C\end{gather}$$
These being the general solution of their respective function
