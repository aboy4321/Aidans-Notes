## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
*Terminal Velocity* is the limit of the velocity function as $t$ (time) approaches infinity.$$\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}v(t)=v_T$$
*Stokes Law* states that the damping force is applied to spherical objects through an environment by$$D=6\pi\eta Rv$$
Where $\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid and $R$ is the radius of the object.
