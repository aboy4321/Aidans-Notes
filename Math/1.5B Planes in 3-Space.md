## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
We can define two planes as **parallel** if the same normal vector $\vec{n}$.
- If two planes are parallel then they **do not** intersect
- If two planes are not parallel then they intersect in a **line**

We define a **trace** of a plane $P$ as the intersection of $P$ with a coordinate plane.
