## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
We define a **plane** as the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that satisfy. a given linear equation, and it given by the equation $$\vec{n}\cdot\vec{x}=d$$
for some $\vec{n}$.

To identify a plane $\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify how the plane is oriented in space. A vector $\vec{n}$ that is perpendicular to a plane is called a **normal vector.** This vector determines how the plane is oriented. 

**Vector form:** $$n\cdot\langle x,y,z\rangle$$

**Scalarforms:**$$\begin{align}a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)=\\ax+by+cz=\end{align}$$

where $d = \vec{n}\cdot\langle x_0, y_0,z_0\rangle=ax_0+by_0+cz_0$
## Additional Idea(s)
A plane is determined in each of the following cases. In each case a point on the plane and normal vector to the plane can be determined in order to find an equation for the plane
1. Three noncollinear points 
2. Two lines that intersect in a point 
3. A line and a point not on it
4. Two distinct parallel lines
