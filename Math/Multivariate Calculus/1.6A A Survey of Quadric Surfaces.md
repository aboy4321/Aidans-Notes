## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
**Quadric surfaces** are the surface analogs of a conic sections (recall that a conic section is a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by a quadratic equation in two variables).

A **quadratic surface** is defined by a quadratic equation in *three* variables$$Ax^2+by^2+Cz^2+Dxy+Eyz+Fzx+ax+by+cz+d$$
We assume that the coefficients $A$ to $F$ are all nonzero numbers.

## Additional Idea(s)
The surface analogs of ellipses are the egg-shaped *ellipsoids*, where ellipsoids in standard form have the form$$(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2+(\frac{z}{c})^2=1$$
The surface analogs of the hyperbolas are the **hyperboloids**, which come in two types, depending on whether the surface has one or two components (which we call **sheets**). In standard position are $$\begin{gather}\text{One sheet:}\; (\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2=(\frac{z}{c})^2+1\\\text{Two sheets:}\;(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2=(\frac{z}{c})^2-1\end{gather}$$
