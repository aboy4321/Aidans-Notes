Continuation of [[1.2A Three-Dimensional Space (Shapes and Distance)]]
## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
We are able to describe most curves in 3-D space *parametrically*, meaning we can describe a curve using three different equations, $x(t),y(t),z(t)$. We cab combine these equations to form the components of a vector$$\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\rangle$$ For lines however we use a direction vector $\langle a,b,c\rangle$. So we can describe a line using this equation for vector parametrization$$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{r}_0+t\vec{v}=\langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle+t\langle a,b,c\rangle$$
We find equations for our parametric equations with$$\begin{gather}x(t)=x_0+at\\y(t)=y_0+bt\\z(t)=z_0+ct\end{gather}$$
## Additional Idea(s)
Essentially we can obtain our line by taking our direction vector, and using the vector parametrization or parametric equations for a line, where our segment is parametrized by our vector function.
