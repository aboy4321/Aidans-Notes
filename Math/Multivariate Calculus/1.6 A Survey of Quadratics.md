## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
**Quadric surfaces** are the surface analogs of a conic sections (recall that a conic section is a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by a quadratic equation in two variables).

A **quadric surface** is defined by a quadratic equation in *three* variables$$Ax^2+by^2+Cz^2+Dxy+Eyz+Fzx+ax+by+cz+d$$
We assume that the coefficients $A$ to $F$ are all nonzero numbers.
