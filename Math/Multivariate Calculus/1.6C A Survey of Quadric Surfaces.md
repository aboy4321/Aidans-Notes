## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
Another example of quadric surfaces would be the **quadratic cylinders**, those having the quality where the base curve is a conic section.

There are *three* types of quadratic cylinders 
1. **Elliptic cylinder:** $(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2=1$
2. **Hyperbolic cylinder:**$(\frac{y}{b})-\frac{x}{a}$
