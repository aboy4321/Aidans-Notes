## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
We define the angle between vectors as $\theta$ with the equations$$\begin{gather}\cos{\theta}=\frac{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{v}}{||\vec{v}||\;||\vec{w||}}\\or\\\theta=\cos^{-1}{(\frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||\;||\vec{w}||})}\end{gather}$$
Other than the zero vector, we define two vectors $v$ and $w$ to be orthogonal if and only if $\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}=0$
## Additional Idea(s)
If the dot product of two vectors is negative, we know that the angle between those vectors is **obtuse**.

If the dot product of two vectors is positive, we know that the angle between vectors is **acute**.
