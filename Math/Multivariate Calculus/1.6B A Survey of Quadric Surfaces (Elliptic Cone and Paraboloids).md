## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
To describe the *traces* of a quadric surface, we set the individual values to zero (setting $x$ then solving etc.).

The following equation defines an **elliptic cone**$$(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2=(\frac{z}{c})^2$$
An elliptic cone is a transition case between a one sheet to a two sheet hyperboloid, with the one sheet being "pinched" at its narrowest part to form an elliptic cone, then the cone separates to form 
the two components of a two sheet hyperboloid.
## Additional Idea(s)
The third main family of quadric surfaces are the **paraboloids**, there being two types$$\begin{gather}\text{Elliptic:}\;z=(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2\\\text{Hyperbolic:}\;z=(\frac{x}{a})^2-(\frac{y}{b})^2\end{gather}$$

The minimum of the **elliptic paraboloid** at the origin and the "saddle" of the **hyperbolic paraboloid** shape are models for local behavior near critical points of functions of two variables.
