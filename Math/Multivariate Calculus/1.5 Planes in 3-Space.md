## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
To identify a plane $\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify how the plane is oriented in space. A vector $\vec{n}$ that is perpendicular to a plane is called a **normal vector.** This vector determines how the plane is oriented. 

**Vector form:** $$n\cdot\langle x,y,z\rangle$$
**Scalarforms:**$$\begin{align}a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)\end{align}$$
