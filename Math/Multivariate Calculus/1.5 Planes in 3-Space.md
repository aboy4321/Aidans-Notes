## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
To identify a plane $\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify how the plane is oriented in space. A vector $\vec{n}$ that is perpendicular to a plane is called a **normal vector.** This vector determines how the plane is oriented. 

**Vector form:** $$n\cdot\langle x,y,z\rangle$$

**Scalarforms:**$$\begin{align}a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)=\\ax+by+cz=\end{align}$$

where $d = \vec{n}\cdot\langle x_0, y_0,z_0\rangle=ax_0+by_0+cz_0$
## Additional Idea(s)
A plane is determined in each of the following cases. In each case a point on the plane and normal vector to the plane can be determined in order to find an equation for the plane
