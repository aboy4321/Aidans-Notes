## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
### *Universal Statements*
For an open sentence $P(x)$ over a domain $S$, a **universal statement** is a statement of the form$$\forall x\in S,P(x).$$
In words this would be *for every/all $x$ in $S$, $P(x)$*.

This is defined to be true if, and only if, $P(x)$ is true for every  $x\in S$, and it is false if, and only if, $P(x)$ is *false for at least one*  $x\in S$. A value of $x$ for which $P(x)$ is false is called a **counterexample** to the universal statements.
### *Existential Statements*
For an open sentence $P(x)$ over a domain $S$, an **existential statement** is statement of the form$$\exists x\in S, P(x).$$
In words this would be *there exists $x$ in $S$ such that* $P(x)$.

This is true if, and only if, $P(x)$ is *true for at least one* $x\in S$, and it is false if, and only if, $P(x)$ is false for all $x\in S$.
## Additional Idea(s)
### *Negations*
Let $P(x)$ be an open sentence over $S$. Then we have$$\begin{gather}\neg(\forall x\in S,P(x))\equiv\exists x\in S,\neg P(x)\\\neg(\exists x\in S, P(x))\equiv\forall x\in S,\neg P(x)\end{gather}$$
### *Open sentence with two variables*
Let $P(x,y)$ be an open sentence with a domain for $x$ being $S$ and a domain for $y$ being $T$. The two quantified statements would be $$\forall x\in S, \forall y\in T,P(x,y)$$
In words: For all $x\in S$ and $y\in T$, $P(x,y)$ and $$\exists x\in S,\exists y\in T, P(x,y).$$ In words: There exists $x \in S$ and $y\in T$ such that $P(x,y)$.

The negations of these statements being $$\neg(\forall x\in S,\forall y\in T,P(x,y))\equiv\exists x\in S,\exists y\in T,\neg P(x,y).$$and$$\neg(\exists x\in S,\exists y\in T, P(x,y))\equiv\forall x\in S, \forall y\in T,\neg P(x,y).$$
