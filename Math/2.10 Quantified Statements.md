## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
For an open sentence $P(x)$ over a domain $S$, a **universal statement** is a statement of the form$$\forall x\in S,P(x).$$
In words this would be *for every/all $x$ in $S$, $P(x)$*.

This is defined to be true if, and only if, $P(x)$ is true for every  $x\in S$, and it is false if, and only if, $P(x)$ is *false for at least one*  $x\in S$. A value of $x$ for which $P(x)$ is false is called a **counterexample** to the univers
