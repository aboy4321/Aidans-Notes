## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
To describe the *traces* of a quadric surface, we set the individual values to zero (setting $x$ then solving etc.).

The following equation defines an **elliptic cone**$$(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2=(\frac{z}{c})^2$$
An elliptic cone is a transition case between a one sheet to a two sheet hyperboloid, with the one sheet being "pinched" at its narrowest part to form an elliptic cone, then the cone separates to form .
