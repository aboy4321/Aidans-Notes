## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
A *first order linear diff equation* is an ODE where only the 1st derivative appears and the variables within are only to the first power, thus being linear, usually taking the form$$u'+h(t)\cdot u=g(t)$$
An *integrating factor* is used to solve a first order ODE, they are multiplying factors used to turn our inexact function, into an exact function that can integrate cleanly.

We find our *integrating factor* $e^{H(t)}$ by taking $H(t)$ to any specific antiderivative of $h(t)$
