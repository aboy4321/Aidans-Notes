## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
A *falling object* has both the force of its weight $W$ and the its drag $D$ acting upon it. The weight being the product of an object's mass and our Earth's  gravity, and an object's drag (given it is small and spherical) is the product of the object's drag coefficient and velocity.$$W=mg,\;\;D=bv$$
## Additional Idea(s)
If an object is massive and not spherical we can model its drag force $D$ as$$D=\frac12c\rho Av^2$$
Where $\rho$ is the air density, $A$ is the frontal surface area, $c$ is the drag coefficient, and $v$ is the velocity to be squared.
