## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
We are able to describe most curves in 3-D space *parametrically*, meaning we can describe a curve using three different equations, $x(t),y(t),z(t)$. We cab combine these equations to form the components of a vector$$\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\rangle$$ For lines however we use a direction vector $\langle a,b,c\rangle$. So we can describe a line using this equation for vectior $$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{r}_0+t\vec{v}=\langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle+t\langle a,b,c\rangle$$
