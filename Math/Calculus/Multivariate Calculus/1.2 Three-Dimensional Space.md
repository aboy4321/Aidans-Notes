## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
In *three dimensional space* we denote a coordinate by a triple $(a,b,c)$, and the set of all triples as $\textbf{R}^3$.

We are able to find the distance and magnitude of a vector between two points $P$ and $Q$ by $$|P-Q|=\sqrt{(a_2-a_1)^2+(b_2-b_1)^2+(c_2-c_1)^2}$$
We are also able to get the standard equation of a **sphere** and **cylinder**  from this formula $$\begin{gather}(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=R^2\\(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=R^2\end{gather}$$
