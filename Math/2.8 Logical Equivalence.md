## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
Let $R$ and $S$ be two compound statements involving the same compound statements. Then $R$ and $S$ are called **equivalent** if $R$ and $S$ have the same truth values for all combinations of their component statements. If they are equivalent, then we denote this equivalence by $R\equiv S$.
### *Theorem:*
Let $P$ and $Q$ be statements,  then $P\Rightarrow Q\equiv(\neg P)\vee Q$.
