## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
- A set $A$ is called  a *subset* of a set $B$ if every element of A also belongs to the set $B$, denoted as $A\subseteq B$. 

- If $A$ is not a subset of $B$ we write $A\nsubseteq B$.  

- A set $A$ is  a *proper subset* of a set $B$ if $A\subseteq B$ but $A \neq B$, we write this as $A \subset B$.

- The *empty set* $\phi$ is a subset of every set.
## Additional Idea(s)
- Two sets $A$ and $B$ would be equal if they have the same number of elements and we (of course) denote that as $A=B$.

- The *power set* is the set consisting of all possible subsets of a given set $A$. We denote power sets by $\mathcal{P}(A)$.
