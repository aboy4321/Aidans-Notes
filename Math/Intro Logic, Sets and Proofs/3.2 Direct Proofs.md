## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
Supposing we have two open sentences $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ over a domain $S$, and the universal statement of the form$$\forall x\in S,P(x)\implies Q(x).$$
To give a **direct proof** of this statement, we assume $P(x)$ is true for an arbitrary element $x\in S$ and show that $Q(x)$ is true for the same element $x$.

### *Basic Properties of Integers*
- The negative of every integer is an integer
- The sum and difference of every two integers is an integer
- The product of every two integers is an integer
- An integer $n$ is even if $n=2k$ for some integer $k$
- An integer $n$ is odd if $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$
