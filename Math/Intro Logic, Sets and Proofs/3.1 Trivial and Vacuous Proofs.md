If $Q(x)$ is true for all $x\in S$ then $P(x)\implies Q(x)$ is true for all $x\in S$. To show $$\forall x\in S,P(x)\implies Q(x) $$is true, we can show that $Q(x)$ is true for all $x\in S$. This proof is called a **trivial proof.**

If $P(x)$ is false for all $x\in S$, then $P(x)\implies Q(x)$ is true for all $x\in S$. To show$$\forall x\in S,P(x)\implies Q(x)$$
is a true statement, we can show that P(x) is false for all $x\in S$. This proof is called a **vacuous proof.**
