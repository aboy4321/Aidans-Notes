The **disjunction** of statements $P$ and $Q$ is the statement$$P\;\text{or}\;Q$$
and is denoted by $P\vee Q$ and is true if at least one of $P$ and $Q$ is true, if both are false then the disjunction is false.

The **conjunction** of statements $P$ and $Q$ is the statement$$P\;\text{and}\;Q$$
and is denoted by $P\wedge Q$, only being true if **BOTH** $P$ and $Q$ are true, if one of them is false then the conjunction is false.
