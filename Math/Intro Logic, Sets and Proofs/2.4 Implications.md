## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
For the statements $P$ and $Q$, the **implication** (or the conditional) is the statement$$\text{if}\;P,\;\text{then}\;Q$$
and is denoted by $P\Rightarrow Q$, and is false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, otherwise the implication is true.

There are multiple ways to express $P\Rightarrow Q$:
- If $P$, then $Q$
- $Q$ if $P$
- $P$ implies $Q$
- $P$ only if $Q$
- $P$ is sufficient for $Q$
- $Q$ is necessary for $P$
