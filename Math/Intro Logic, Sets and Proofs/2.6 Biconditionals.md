## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
For the statements $P$ and $Q$ , the **converse** of the implication $P\implies Q$ is the statement $Q\implies P$ 

For statements $P$ and $Q$ , the conjunction$$(P\implies Q)\wedge(Q\implies P)$$
is called the **biconditional** of $P$ and $Q$, denoted by $P\iff Q$ but we can also express it as
- $P$ is equivalent to $Q$ 
- $P$ if and only if $Q$
- $P$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for $Q$
