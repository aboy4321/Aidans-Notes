## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
We denote the *union of two or more sets* $A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots,A_n$ is denoted by $A_1\cup A_2\cup \dots\cup A_n=\bigcup^{n}_{i=1}A_i$ and is denoted by $$\bigcup^n_{i=1}A_i=\{x:x\in A_i\;\text{for some}\;i,\;1\leq i\leq n\}$$
We  denote the intersection of the sets $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$ with $n\geq2$ is denoted by $A_1\cap A_2\cap\dots\cap A_n=\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}A_i$ and is defined as$$\bigcap^n_{i=1}A_i=\{x:x\in A_i\;\text{for every }i,1\leq i\leq n\}$$
If a set $I$ is given called an index set is given then we write $S_{\alpha},\alpha\in I$ to describe the collection of sets $S_{\alpha}$, where $\alpha \in I$. Such a collection is called an indexed collection of sets .
