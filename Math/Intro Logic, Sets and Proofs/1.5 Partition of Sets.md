## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
A  *partition* of a set $A$ can be defined as a collection $S$ of a nonempty subsets of $A$ such that every element of $A$ belongs to exactly one subset in $S$. That is, $S$ has to satisfy
1. $X\neq \Phi$ for every $X\in S$
2. for every two sets $X,Y\in S$ either $X=Y$ or $X\cap Y=\Phi$
3. $\bigcup_{X\in S} X= A$
