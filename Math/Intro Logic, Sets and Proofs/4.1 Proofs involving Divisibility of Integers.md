## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
In general, for integers $m$ and $n$ with $n\neq 0$, we say that $n$ **divides** $m$ if there is an integer $k$ such that $m=nk$. In this case, we write $n\mid k$. Another way w can say this is to say $m$ is a multiple of $n$ and $n$ is a divisor of $m$. If $n$ does not satisfy any of these, we write $n\nmid m$.
