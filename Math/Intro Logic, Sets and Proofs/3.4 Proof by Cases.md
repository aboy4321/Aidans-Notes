## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
While attempting to give a proof of a mathematical statement concerning elements $x\in S$, is can be useful to see that $x$ possesses one or two or more properties. A common property which $x$ might possess is belonging to a particular subset of $S$. If we can verify the truth of the statement for each property that $x$ might have, then we can prove the statement. This is called **Proof by Cases.**
