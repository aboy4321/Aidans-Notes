## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
The **contrapositive** of a statement $P\implies Q$ is the implication $(\neg Q)\implies(\neg P)$.
### *Theorem*
For every two statements $P$ and $Q$, the implication $P\implies Q$ and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; in notation$$P\implies Q\equiv(\neg Q)\implies(\neg P)$$
