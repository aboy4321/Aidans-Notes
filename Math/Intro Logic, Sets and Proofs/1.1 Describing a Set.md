## Definition
A *set* is a collection of objects, where those objects are called its *elements*. Typically we define a set as a capital letter and its elements as lowercase letters.
## Additional Ideas
#### The Empty Set
If a set contains no element, we call it the *empty set* and denote it by  $\phi$

#### Special Sets
The following letters denote the special sets:
- N - Set of all positive integers
- Z - Set of all integers
- Q - Set of all rational numbers
- I - Set of all irrational numbers
- R - Set of all real numbers
- C - Set of all complex numbers

#### More notation
- If $a$ is an element of a set $A$, we say $a$ belongs to $A$ and can write that as $a\in A$ 
- If $a$ is not an element of $A$, we write $a\notin A$
- We denote the number of elements or the cardinality of a $A$ as $|A|$
