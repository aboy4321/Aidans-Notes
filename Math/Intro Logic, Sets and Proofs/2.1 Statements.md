## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
A *Statement* is a declarative sentence or assertion that is true or false (but not both). We use the truth values $T$ (true) and $F$ (false) to represent statements.

An *open statement* is declarative sentence that contains one or more variables, each variable representing a value in some prescribed set, called the **domain** of the variable. Which becomes a statement when values from their respective domains are substituted for these values. An open statement contains a variable $x$ and is typically represented as $P(x)$.
