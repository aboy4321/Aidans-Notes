## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
The **union** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cup B$, which is set that is basically the combination of the two sets.$$A\cup B=\{x:x\in A\;\text{or}\;x\in B\}$$

The **intersection** of the two sets, denoted by $A\cap B$, is the set with the common elements of $A$ and $B$. $$A\cap B=\{x:x\in A\;\text{and}\;x\in B\}$$
**NOTE**: For any two sets $A$ and $B$, we will always have$$A\cap B\subseteq A\cup B$$
And if $A\cap B = \phi$, then we say $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint**.
## Additional Idea(s)
The *difference* between two sets is denoted by $A-B$ and defined as$$A-B=\{x:x\in A\;and\;x\notin B\}$$
For a set $A\subseteq U$, its *complement* $\bar{A}$ is$$\bar{A}=U-A=\{x:x\in U\;and\;x\notin A\}$$
