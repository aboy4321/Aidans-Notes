### Derivatives
We can express the ratio infinitesimally small change of a independent variable $t$ to the infinitesimally small change of a dependent variable $x$. In mathematical notation this would be written as $\frac{dx}{dt}$.

This ratio would defined as the derivative of a function $x$ with respect to our time $t$. We won't discuss the rules of differentiation in this note.

### Set
In math we would call a collection of objects a **set**, and the individual members of the set **elements**. One example of a set would be an **interval**, which is the *set of all numbers* between any two points on a line.

### Function (One Independent Variable)
This section has a couple different definitions, each being relatively the same,  but here is my favorite.

A function is a correspondence between a domain set $D$ and a range set $R$ that assigns to each element of $D$ a unique element of $R$
