## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
Suppose you make an **initial deposit** of $P_0$ dollars into a savings account that has an APY of $r\%$ where we express $r$ as a decimal (i.e. $5\%$ APY is expressed as $r=0.05$). Assuming interest is compounded continuously and that no money is withdrawn from the account and no money is deposited into the account, the balance at a time of $t$ years is$$P(t)=P_0(1+r)^t$$
