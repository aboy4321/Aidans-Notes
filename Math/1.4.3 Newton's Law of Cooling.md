## Definition(s) & Idea(s)
*Newton's Law of Cooling* states that the rate of change of an object's temperature is proportional to the difference between the object's temperature and the temperature of its surroundings.

We assume the temperature of the surroundings, called the **ambient temperature** to be a constant $A > 0$ and the temperature of the object at time $t$ denoted by $u(t)$, then we describe Newton's Law of Cooling as the ODE $$u'=k\cdot(A-u)$$
where $k$ is some constant.

If we place an object at a time $t = 0$ we can so
