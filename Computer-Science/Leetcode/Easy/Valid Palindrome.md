### Prompt
Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.
### Intuition
To switch the positions of the string in a linear manner while also keeping the punctuality of a sentence, we need to use two-pointers. 

I'm thinking of having one for the beginning and the end of the string. However, some strings may end in a symbol rather than a character, meaning we only need to flip the characters and must somehow remove the symbols. 
### My Solution

```python

```
