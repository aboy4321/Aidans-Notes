### Prompt
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.
### Intuition
Since we need to output an array I believe we need to initialize an empty set `arr = []`. We would need to count the frequency of each unique number, and for each 1 value of `k`, append that unique number to our empty set `arr`.
### My Solution

```python

```
