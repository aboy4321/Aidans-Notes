### Definition
A procedural solution to a problem is where you focus on the *process* that your program must follow to solve the problem.
### Outline of Procedural Programming
- Create a clear high-level definition of the overall process that your program will  have to implement
- Segment the process into workable units of computation that are self-contained. Usually corresponding to functions
- We can code the functions in terms of processing basic types of data
